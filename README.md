# Graph-Visualizer-
This C++ program is a Graphical Graph Editor and Visualization Tool using WinBGIm. It enables users to build and modify weighted/directed graphs interactively (adding/deleting nodes and edges). Crucially, it provides a dynamic, step-by-step visualization of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal algorithms.
